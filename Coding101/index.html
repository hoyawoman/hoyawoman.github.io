<p>Thurgood Marshall was born in an animal shelter in West Virginia in May of 2017. As the youngest cat in the household, Thurgood enjoys roughhousing, playing fetch, and generally getting up to shenanigans. He's also the cuddliest lapcat of the Capitol Kitties. Thurgood has bounced back from a broken hip(!) in February 2018. He is named after the first African American member of the Supreme Court.</P>

<p>Mae Jemison is the newest member of the household. She adopted her hooman at New Year's 2018 when temperatures dropped to the single digits. A sweet street cat, she's settled into domesticated life very well and shows no interest in returning to the not-so-great outdoors.</p>
